#Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
This is a mini project named Tic Tac Toe game, which I built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The user interface is styled with CSS to provide a clean look, while JavaScript handles the game logic and interactions. Players can click on the grid to make their moves, with the game automatically detecting wins. This project helped me to improve my skills in web development and provided a fun and engaging way to practice coding.
